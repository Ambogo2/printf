# Printf
This is a collaborative project to create a custom made printf function which takes inputs and arguments just like the printf available in the standard C library.

## Overview of printf
The printf function in C is used for formatted output. It’s part of the Standard Input/Output Library (stdio.h) and is responsible for printing data to the standard output (typically the console) in a specified format

## Format Specifiers
Format specifiers in printf are placeholders that tell the function how to format and print data. They start with a ‘%’ character and are followed by a character that specifies the data type to be printed.
